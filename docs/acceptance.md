# MVP acceptance run

The acceptance criteria of the spec (#1), checked by hand against production before a release. Record the results (and the memory numbers) in the release notes.

Commands assume a local clone with `.env` from `scripts/setup-deploy.sh` loaded (`set -a; . ./.env; set +a`), so `$KAMAL_HOST` is the server. The app container is the one labelled `service=tg-mcp`.

## 1. From `claude mcp add` to the first `list_chats` in under 2 minutes

With a stopwatch, from a machine where the server was never added:

```sh
claude mcp remove telegram 2>/dev/null
claude mcp add --transport http telegram https://tgmcp.qelphybox.space/mcp
```

`/mcp` → `telegram` → Authenticate → scan the QR → Allow → back in Claude Code ask "list my latest Telegram chats". Stop when the chats appear. No token is copied by hand at any point.

## 2. Two-step verification works

Repeat 1 with an account that has a cloud password: the page asks for it after the QR, a wrong password shows an error and allows a retry, the right one goes on to Consent.

## 3. A database dump without Tokens gives access to no Telegram session

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/tgmcp-dump
ssh deploy@$KAMAL_HOST 'docker run --rm -v tg-mcp-data:/data:ro busybox tar -C /data -cf - .' | tar -xf - -C /tmp/tgmcp-dump
strings /tmp/tgmcp-dump/tg-mcp.db* | grep -i -e '<your @username>' -e '<a word from a recent message>'   # expect nothing
```

What is in there: Grants (account id, sealed session), Tokens (id, verifier, wrapped key), OAuth clients. That none of it opens a session is proven by `sessions::tests::database_dump_without_tokens_opens_nothing`, which tries every 32-byte window of a real database file as the key.

## 4. A server restart doesn't need a re-login

```sh
ssh deploy@$KAMAL_HOST 'docker restart $(docker ps -qf label=service=tg-mcp)'
```

Then call `whoami` in Claude Code: it answers without a browser opening. (Every deploy is also a restart.)

## 5. Disconnect really logs the Telegram session out

Either end **Unofficial MCP Server** in Telegram → Settings → Devices and check that the next tool call asks to authenticate again, or run the revocation check, which logs in with its own client, revokes through `/revoke` and checks the old Tokens are dead:

```sh
python3 scripts/revoke-check.py
```

Then confirm the session is gone from Settings → Devices.

## 6. Memory: ≈0 per idle Account, single-digit MB per active one

```sh
mem() { ssh deploy@$KAMAL_HOST 'docker stats --no-stream --format "{{.MemUsage}}" $(docker ps -qf label=service=tg-mcp)'; }
```

1. Right after a deploy, with no tool calls yet: `mem` → **baseline**.
2. Make one call per Account you have connected (e.g. `whoami`), then `mem` → **active**. (active − baseline) / Accounts ≈ memory per active Account.
3. Wait 11 minutes without calls (Live clients are evicted after 10, `TG_MCP_LIVE_CLIENT_IDLE_SECS`), then `mem` → should be back near the baseline: ≈0 per idle Account.

Allocators don't always return memory to the OS immediately, so step 3 may sit somewhat above the baseline; what matters is that it doesn't grow with the number of idle Accounts.

## 7. Anonymous endpoints are rate-limited per client IP

From one machine, each block a minute after the previous one (buckets refill at their per-minute rate). Defaults: `/register` 5 at once, `/authorize` 5, `/token` and `/revoke` 10 each.

```sh
BASE=https://tgmcp.qelphybox.space
hit() { curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} ' "$@"; }

# /register: 5 pass, then 429. A forged X-Forwarded-For doesn't help.
CID=$(curl -s -X POST $BASE/register -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"redirect_uris":["http://127.0.0.1:43123/callback"]}' | sed -E 's/.*"client_id":"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do hit -X POST $BASE/register -H 'content-type: application/json' -H "X-Forwarded-For: 198.51.100.$i" -d '{}'; done; echo
# expect: 400 400 400 400 429
curl -si -X POST $BASE/register -d '{}' | grep -i -e '^HTTP' -e '^retry-after'   # expect 429 and retry-after: 1..12

# /token: 10 pass (400, bad request), then 429. Same for /revoke.
for i in $(seq 12); do hit -X POST $BASE/token -d grant_type=nope; done; echo   # expect 10 × 400, then 429 429

# Not limited: health, metadata, /mcp (401 without a token).
for i in $(seq 20); do hit $BASE/healthz; hit $BASE/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server; hit -X POST $BASE/mcp; done; echo
# expect only 200 and 401, never 429
```

Login flows (each holds a Telegram connection for up to 10 minutes): 3 at once per IP, then `temporarily_unavailable`.

```sh
CH=$(head -c 32 /dev/urandom | openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | base64 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '=')
for i in 1 2 3 4; do
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{redirect_url}\n' \
    "$BASE/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=$CID&redirect_uri=http://127.0.0.1:43123/callback&code_challenge=$CH&code_challenge_method=S256"
done
# expect: 3 × "303 https://tgmcp.qelphybox.space/login/…", then "303 http://127.0.0.1:43123/callback?error=temporarily_unavailable…"
# One more within the minute: 429 (5 /authorize requests per burst).
```

Then `kamal app logs | grep -e 'rate limited' -e 'login flow refused'`: the lines carry `route=` and `client_ip=` **your public IP**. If `client_ip` is a Docker address (`172.x`) instead, every client shares one bucket: check `TG_MCP_TRUST_FORWARDED_FOR` and the proxy.
